<p><img src="gym.jpg">I go to the gym everyday because I am trying to lose some weight.</p>
<p>I do see a lot of progress because I have muscles now. My posture is really good now because it has been a year since i have been going to the gym. Last year, my posture was like a turtles back but now it is straight.</p>
<p>Also the gym allows me to forget all about my stress and allows me to work on myself.</p>
